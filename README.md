```
My love for technology began when I participated in IIT techfest and gained a profound understanding of programming. I started my coding journey as a passionate web developer and designer, eager to solve real-life problems and create captivating visual experiences. Each day, I delve into learning new technologies and techniques, embracing the thrill of constant growth. Coding empowers me to turn imagination into reality, and the joy it brings reaffirms my love for this creative and ever-evolving field.
